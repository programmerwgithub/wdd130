    <p>Hi Everyone! I am the youngest of 5 children. I love to read and write. My happy place is at the library, perusing or checking out books. It is a passion of mine, I guess you could say. When I was a child, I used to wonder how my mother could read so fast and I questioned whether I would ever be able to do it as well. Now, many years later, I have learned the art of reading quickly. </p>
    <p>I have not firmly decided a career that I want to study, my two options being a writer or something in the medical field. I am taking WDD-130 in pursuit of a Systems Administration certificate. I have always wanted to be able to diagnoss an issue when a computer acts up, so that is what I am working for. </p>
    <p>One of my favorite things about BYUI is the focus on God. Many schools just focus on the information and leave God out of it. However, I feel that nothing is complete unless you include God. One of my favorite scriptures is 1 Corinthians 10:13. It says, "There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it." I love this scripture becuase of how it points out that, no matter what we are going through, we will never be given a trial that will be too much for us. </p>
    <footer>I look forward to learning so much in this class.</footer>
